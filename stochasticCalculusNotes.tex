\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Brownian motion}
A random walk from time $t=t$ to $t=T$ can be defined as:
\begin{equation}
	Z_T-Z_t=\sum\limits_{j=t}^{j=T}\epsilon_j
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_j\iid\textsc{N}(0,1)$ are the independent and identically distributed (iid) normal random variable(s)\\
\\
Given that they're iid, the expectation and variance are found as follows:
\begin{align}
	\E\left[Z_T-Z_t\right] &= \E\left[\sum\limits_{j=t}^{j=T}\epsilon_j\right]=(T-t)\cdot 0=0\\
	\mathrm{Var}(Z_T-Z_t) &= \mathrm{Var}\left(\sum\limits_{j=t}^{j=T}\epsilon_j\right)=(T-t)\cdot\mathrm{Var}(\epsilon_j) = \Delta t.\label{VarianceOfBrownianMotion}
\end{align}
\\
Generalising to a time interval of $t\rightarrow (t+\Delta)$ we find that as $\Delta\to 0$
\begin{equation}\label{BrownianInfinitessimalLimit}
	\lim\limits_{\Delta\to 0}\left(Z_{t+\Delta} - Z_t\right)=dZ_t
\end{equation}
\\
Combining equations \ref{VarianceOfBrownianMotion} with \ref{BrownianInfinitessimalLimit}, we see that in the limit of $\Delta\to 0$, the variance of Brownian motion tends to the corresponding infinitesimal time increment:
\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Var}(dZ_t)&\to dt \\
	\sigma&\sim\sqrt{dt}
\end{align}
\noindent where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Brownian process $dZ_t$.
\subsubsection{Key properties of Brownian motion} \label{KeyProperties_BrownianMotion}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\E\left[dZ_t\right]=0$ hence $\mathrm{Var}(dZ_t)=\E\left[dZ_t^2\right]$
	\item $\mathrm{Var}(dZ_t)=dt=dZ_t^2$, or the temporal variation scales with the square of the spatial variation. \label{dZVsdt}
	\item $\mathrm{Cov}(dZ_s,dZ_t)=0\quad\forall\: s\not=t$

\section{From a Taylor expansion to Ito's lemma}
\subsection{The Taylor expansion}
Consider a function of two variables, $f(x,t)$. This has a two dimensional Taylor expansion about the point(s) $(x_0,t_0)$ of:
\begin{multline}
	f(x,t)=f + f_x\cdot(x-x_0) + f_t\cdot(t-t_0) + \\ \frac{1}{2}\left[f_{xx}\cdot(x-x_0)^2 + f_{tt}\cdot(t-t_0)^2 + 2f_{xt}\cdot(x-x_0)(t-t_0)\right]
\end{multline}
\noindent where the right hand sign terms are evaluated at $(x_0,t_0)$, and $f_t$ denotes $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$.\\
\\
We rewrite $(x-x_0)=dx$ and $(t-t_0)=dt$ in the above and move the first term to the right hand side to get
\begin{equation}\label{Taylor2D}
	f(x,t)-f(x-x_0,t-t_0)=f_x\,dx + f_t\,dt + \frac{1}{2}\left[f_{xx}\,dx^2 + f_{tt}\,dt^2 + 2f_{xt}\,dx\,dt\right].
\end{equation}
\noindent Now we recognise that the left hand side of equation \ref{Taylor2D} is the infinitesimal change in $f$. Further, the only quadratic variation of significance on the right hand side is $dx^2$. This is because (as per point \ref{dZVsdt} in subsection \ref{KeyProperties_BrownianMotion}) the other two quadratic terms, $dt^2$ and $dx\,dt$ have temporal variations of $dt$ raised to powers of 2 and $\frac{3}{2}$ respectively. These are higher, and therefore decay faster than that of $dx^2$ which is equivalent to $dt^1$. We therefore disregard the other terms and continue with the following:
\begin{equation}\label{Taylor2DFirstOrder}
	df=f_x\,dx+f_t\,dt+\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}\,dx^2.
\end{equation}
\noindent This is the 2D Taylor expansion of a stochastic differential equation to `first' order. Note that we have terms that vary with $dx$ and $dt$ only (because $dx^2=dt$), but have to carry a second partial derivative which wouldn't be the case in a regular non-stochastic function expansion.

\subsection{Geometric Brownian Motion}
We now introduce Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) as
\begin{equation}\label{GBM}
	\frac{dS}{S}=\mu dt+\sigma dB_t
\end{equation}
where $S$ denotes the spot price of some financial instrument (spatial variation), $\mu$ characterises a deterministic drift term (temporal variation), and $\sigma$ scales the stochastic component (random variation) characterised by the Brownian motion / Weiner process $dB_t$.\\
\\
We substitute equation \ref{GBM} into that of the expansion in equation \ref{Taylor2DFirstOrder}, observing that the variation in the underlying $dS$ takes the place of the spatial variation $dx$, and the variation in time $dt$ will be switched in and out with that of the Brownian motion $dB_t$:
\begin{equation}
	df=\dpart{f}{S}\,S\left(\mu dt+\sigma dB_t\right)+\dpart{f}{t}\,dt+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}\,S^2\left(\mu dt+\sigma dB_t\right)^2.
\end{equation}
If we expand the squared bracket we'll get three terms, one with $dt^2$, one with $dt\,dB_t$ and one with $dB_t^2$. Of those three, the one with the slowest temporal variation (most important) is $dB_t^2(=dt)$ so we disregard the other two. Rearranging the above then gives:
\begin{equation}\label{ItoAppliedToGBM}
	df=\left(\dpart{f}{S}\,S\mu+\dpart{f}{t}+\frac{S^2\sigma^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial S^2}\right)\,dt + \dpart{f}{S}\,S\sigma\,dB_t
\end{equation}
which is Ito's lemma as applied to GBM.\\
\\
Note that if instead of using equation \ref{GBM} above, we used a general ito diffusion process:
\begin{equation}
	dX_t=\mu\,dt+\sigma\,dB_t
\end{equation}
we'd end up with pretty much the same thing but without all the extra $S$ dependencies.
\subsubsection{Key takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Taylor expansion of SDE requires some additional terms compared to regular deterministic function.
	\item Geometric brownian motion comprises a deterministic drift and a random stochastic variation.
	\item Taylor expanding GBM gives you a version of Ito's lemma describing how a function $f$ varies given a change in the spot price of the underlying $S$.
\end{enumerate}





\section{From a Ito's lemma to Black Scholes PDE}
\subsection{Black Scholes as an expression of the replicating portfolio}
\subsubsection{Replicating portfolio}
The replicating portfolio is a principal that says the payout of an option or derivative can be replicated by holding certain positions in lending / borrowing and the underlying:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Call option = (long $\Delta$ units of the underlying) - ($B$ amount of borrowed cash)
	\item Put option = (short $\Delta$ units of the underlying) + ($B$ amount of borrowed cash)
\end{itemize}
so when looking at a binomial tree describing option prices as certain intermediary dates, to calculate the fair price, you can work backwards from the terminal nodes solving
\begin{align}
	\Delta\,S^{\mathrm{up}}_T-B(1+r)&=V^{\mathrm{up}}_T\\
	\Delta\,S^{\mathrm{down}}_T+B(1+r)&=V^{\mathrm{down}}_T\\
\end{align}
where $r$ is the risk free rate, $S_t^{u/d}$ are the underlying spot prices at time $t$ in the higher/lower price state and $V_t^{u/d}$ are the corresponding option prices. In that framework you would only know the terminal option prices, hence the need to work backwards from the end.\\
\\
Jumping forward, the Black Scholes FORMULA for the price of a call option can be written as
\begin{equation}
	C(S,t)=S_t\Phi(d_1) - k\mathrm{e}^{-rt}\Phi(d_2)
\end{equation}
where $S_t\Phi(d_1)$ represents the long underlying position and the $k\mathrm{e}^{-rt}\Phi(d_2)$ represents the borrowing of cash (discounted back to today's value). Hence the Black Scholes formula is an expression of the replicating portfolio.

\subsubsection{Delta hedging portfolio}
Now denoting an option as $V$, consider a portfolio consisting of going short one option $(-V)$ and long some shares in the underlying $(+\dpart{V}{S})$:
\begin{equation}
	\Pi=-V+\dpart{S}{V}S
\end{equation}
which has an incremental value change over time $\Delta t$ of
\begin{equation}\label{DeltaHedgePortfolio}
	\Delta\Pi=-\Delta V+\dpart{S}{V}\,\Delta S
\end{equation}

\subsection{Ito's lemma application}

Applying equation \ref{ItoAppliedToGBM} to this situation involves substituting $V$, the option price, for the generic function handle $f$. Taking this over the increment of time $\Delta t$, we have
\begin{equation}
	\Delta V=\left(\dpart{V}{S}\,S\mu+\dpart{V}{t}+\frac{S^2\sigma^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}\right)\,\Delta t + \dpart{V}{S}\,S\sigma\,\Delta B_t
\end{equation}
which describes the incremental value change in the option $V$ in response to a change in the underlying $S$. Substituting this into the delta hedging portfolio (equation \ref{DeltaHedgePortfolio}), we get after cancelling some terms
\begin{equation}\label{DeltaHedgeIto}
	\Delta\Pi = -\left(\dpart{V}{t}+\frac{S^2\sigma^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}\right)\Delta t.
\end{equation}
Of note here is that we've managed to eliminate the $dB_t$ term which represented the random stochastic part of the situation. The portfolio is now riskless, with rate of return $r$.\\
\\
The delta hedging portfolio will grow at rate $r$ over time $\Delta t$ according to
\begin{equation}
	r\,\Pi\,\Delta t = \Delta \Pi
\end{equation}
which when equated to equation \ref{DeltaHedgeIto} reveals
\begin{equation}
	r\left(\dpart{V}{S}S-V\right)=-\dpart{V}{t}-\frac{S^2\sigma^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}
\end{equation}
which rearranges to
\begin{equation}
	\dpart{V}{t}+\frac{S^2\sigma^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}+rS\dpart{V}{S}-rV=0
\end{equation}
which is the Black Scholes PDE.
\subsubsection{Key takeaways}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Consider the delta hedging portfolio.
	\item Substitute in Ito's lemma applied to GBM as the option price. Cancel terms.
	\item Equate to the delta hedging portfolio's incremental value change.
	\item Rearrange to get the PDE.
	\item Black Scholes formula is an expression of the replicating portfolio.
\end{enumerate}
